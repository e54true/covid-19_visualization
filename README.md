# 2-Day updates folder

Every two days we will be publicly releasing new data as incremental, by day downloads.

Every folder corresponds to one date and it includes both the unfiltered and filtered (_clean) versions of the dataset. We are also automatically generating the top 1000 frequent terms, bi-grams, and try-grams.

Note that any data here should be added to the previous full version of the dataset, which can be found here:
